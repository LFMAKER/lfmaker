### Hi there! 😁 

My name is Leonardo Oliveira from Brazil (🇧🇷). I've been working as Full Stack  Developer since 2018 and currently I'm working with Node.JS, React.JS, React Native and .NET Core

In my free time I like to play some game, to watch movies 🎞️ and series 📺, to read books 📚, to listen to music and podcast 🎵 and eventually I like to study and watch series about universe 
🌌.
